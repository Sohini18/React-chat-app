# React-Chat-App

The application name is Yumph. Yumph is a React JS based chatting application and a tribute to my favourite web series 'Office'. It has following features-

1. Sign in feature
2. Sound Notifications
3. One to one chats and group chats
4.Image support
5. Showing online/offline status

How to use this app ->

I have used ReactJS and chat engine API to create this application.
As it is based on 'Office' web series, one can only sign in as 'Office' characters and chat as the respective characters.

There are 9 members,
Michael Scott, Dwight, Jim, Pam, Angela, Oscar, Phyllis, Andy and Kevin.

So if you want to sign in, use any of the exact above username and password is same for everyone.
